  "abstract": "This series of projects focus on scientifically modeling human behavior during interactions with computer systems. By analyzing the nuanced actions and decisions users make, we aim to develop a deeper understanding of how humans engage with technology. The insights gained from this modeling can be used to design more intuitive and effective systems that are better aligned with natural human processes and cognitive styles.",
