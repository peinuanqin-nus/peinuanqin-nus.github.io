## Abstract
With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), their role in language education has become increasingly 
prominent. In this project, we explore how LLMs can serve as effective mediators in language learning, helping non-native 
speakers (NNS) build sustainable learning experiences across different contexts. Our goal is to investigate how LLMs can 
take on appropriate roles in the learning process and support various forms of language learning, such as writing and speaking.
