## Abstract
The development of AI-assisted creation tools has brought improvements in efficiency and output quality, 
but it has also introduced a series of challenges. These include a lack of user ownership and autonomy over generated content, 
as well as a decline in users’ critical thinking. Such issues can hinder the development of users’ creative abilities and 
reduce their deep engagement with the content. In response, we are exploring a series of tools aimed at enhancing the quality
and outcomes of creation while preserving the user’s creative experience. Specifically, we are developing a new generation of 
literature review tools and AI-assisted writing tools to advance the current paradigm of Human-AI co-creation.
