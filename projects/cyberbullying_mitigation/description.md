## Abstract
Online environments, particularly those with large teenage communities, frequently face the problem of cyberbullying. While bystander intervention is a proven strategy to mitigate its effects, encouraging direct intervention to directly stop the abuser remains challenging. Through a formative study involving 67 participants, we first identified two major barriers to direct intervention: the effort required to respond and a lack of confidence in expression skills. To address these obstacles, we developed a
Large Language Model (LLM)-driven assistance tool called EmojiGen. In a subsequent between-subjects evaluation with 90 participants and two conditions on a custom-built social media platform, the results showed that EmojiGen significantly increased the frequency of bystanders' direct support and resisting behaviors. It also improved perceptions of defending self-efficacy and knowing how to help while reducing workload and anxiety.
The study has implications for
understanding bystander direct intervention in cyberbullying, and how to develop design solutions to encourage bystander intervention
in social networks.
