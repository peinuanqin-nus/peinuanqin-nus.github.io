## Abstract
Our project aims to address communication barriers in multilingual teams by using advanced AI natural language processing
technology to facilitate smoother communication among individuals from diverse linguistic backgrounds. We specifically
focus on NNS (non-native speakers) and use a powerful language model to build a communication agent that reduces communication
barriers from both the NNS and NS (native speaker) perspectives. The agent helps NNS understand NS speech and prompts NS
to provide more assistance to NNS. Our goal is to increase the speaking share of NNS and enhance team communication efficiency
and collective intelligence, leading to improved team efficiency and collaboration in the global competitive landscape.
