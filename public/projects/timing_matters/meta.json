  "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used to support\nideation in the writing process. However, whether generating ideas\nwith the help of LLMs leads to idea fixation or idea expansion is\nunclear. This study examines how different timings of LLM usage - either at the beginning or after independent ideation - affect\npeople’s perceptions and ideation outcomes in a writing task. In a\ncontrolled experiment with 60 participants, we found that using\nLLMs from the beginning reduced the number of original ideas and\nlowered creative self-efficacy and self-credit, mediated by changes\nin autonomy and ownership. We discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with using LLMs to assist in idea generation.\nWe propose delaying the use of LLMs to support ideation while\nconsidering users’ self-efficacy, autonomy, and ownership of the\nideation outcomes.\n",
