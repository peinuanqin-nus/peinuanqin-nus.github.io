## Abstract
AI-assisted writing can enhance efficiency and support multiple stages of the writing process, but it also raises concerns about writers' autonomy and ownership. Personalized writing support has been proposed as an effective solution; however, few studies have examined how reading behaviors can inform personalized writing. This study investigates the effects of integrating reading highlights for personalized AI-assisted writing. A between-subjects experiment with 46 participants revealed an AI Alienation Effect: the personalization condition promoted participants to produce more highlights. However, highlighting unexpectedly shifted from a meaning-making strategy to an instrumental act of "feeding the AI," leading to significant declines in writers' sense of autonomy, ownership, and self-credit. These findings emphasized the importance of personalization strategies and proposed design implications to prevent AI from alienating human thought and behaviors in AI-assisted writing.
